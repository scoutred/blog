A GPS integration has been on our roadmap for quite awhile now and we're excited it's finally ready. If you're in the field and need access to ScoutRED property data, simply open up ScoutRED on your mobile device and tap on the GPS icon located to the left of the search field. We will detect your location and move the map accordingly. Life in the field just got a whole lot nicer. ;-)

Currently this feature is only available on mobile devices. If you think this would also be helpful on desktop versions of ScoutRED, [let us know](mailto:hello@scoutred.com)!
