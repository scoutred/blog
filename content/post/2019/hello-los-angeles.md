Over the last several years Scoutred has been exclusive to San Diego County. San Diego is our home so it made sense for us to focus where we could connect with our users and understand their needs. I have consumed a fair amount of coffee meeting many of you, learning about your operations and understanding the pain points you deal with on a daily basis. Though Scoutred has evolved to address many of your requests, an important missing feature has been lingering until now: Scoutred in more markets.

It’s my pleasure to announce that we have expanded to Los Angeles County. We’re tracking LA County parcel data on an ongoing basis and we have started adding the City of Los Angeles zoning, community plans, utilities and overlay data. Over the next several months you will see data density increase across LA County. 

From a technical perspective going from one location to two is a difficult undertaking as it tests the assumptions made when launching the first location. Adding in a new county required us to reevaluate our entire data pipeline and mapping experience. Towards the end of 2018, we soft launched our new maps in San Diego, positioning us to support the addition of Los Angeles as well as additional markets. 

Now that we’re in two locations it’s time to start working on where to go next. We have some ideas but we also want your opinion. If you have a moment, [let us know where you would like to see Scoutred expand next](https://goo.gl/forms/9Rk8SYHSs5RhsHqm2).
