Today I'm excited to announce Parcel Collections. Parcel collections allow you to bookmark parcels that you're interested in so you can conveniently return to them at a later time. You can create multiple collections for various projects, keeping track of the parcels that are most important to you. Parcels can exist in multiple collections, and can always be added and removed at any time. To top it off, if you have a [Scoutred subscription](https://scoutred.com/pricing) you can also bulk export the parcel data in CSV format. 

Using collections is easy. Once you're logged in you will now see a new icon on the left side for collections:

Adding parcels to a collection can be done by simply selecting the "Save" button at the top of any parcel details screen. You can add a parcel to any already created collection or create a new one:

Once you have parcels in a collection, you can quickly export the parcel data into CSV format. Exporting the bulk data is a premium feature that's available with either [day passess](https://scoutred.com/pricing) or [monthly subscriptions](https://scoutred.com/pricing):

Additionally, if you have previously unlocked parcels and want to view them again, a special collection has been created for you called "Unlocked Parcels". 

The introduction of Parcel Collections lays the foundation for several features we have in the works. We're excited to have this feature in place so we can start expanding on it's functionality and continuing to make working with parcel data easier for you.
