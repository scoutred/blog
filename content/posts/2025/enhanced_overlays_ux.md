Why hello there old friends. I have been rather distant on this blog for quite sometime. Generally speaking I prefer to spend my time working on building Scoutred instead of promoting it, but without some sort of written presence it's tough for you all to know if we're still making progress overhere. Well rest assured we have been working behind the scenes on a whole bunch of improvements.
